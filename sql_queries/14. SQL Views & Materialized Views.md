SQL Views and Materialized Views are tools for abstracting and simplifying data access, presenting data in a virtual table format without physically storing the data (for Views) or by caching the results of the query (for Materialized Views). They allow you to represent complex queries as simple tables and improve performance in certain cases.

1. SQL Views
A View is a virtual table that represents the result of a stored query. It does not store data physically but rather fetches the data dynamically when queried. Views are used to simplify complex queries, present data in a specific format, and improve security by restricting access to certain columns or rows.

Simple View
A Simple View is created from a single table and represents a subset of that table's data. It can include SELECT statements with conditions, joins, and aggregations, but does not modify the data.

Example of a Simple View:
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE VIEW ActiveEmployees AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, department
FROM employees
WHERE status = 'Active';
Explanation: The ActiveEmployees view presents a filtered view of the employees table, showing only active employees.
Using the Simple View:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM ActiveEmployees;
Explanation: This query retrieves the data from the ActiveEmployees view as if it were a table.
Complex View
A Complex View is typically created from multiple tables (using JOINs) and may include calculated columns or aggregations. It can be more complex and represent data that is the result of multiple relationships or conditions.

Example of a Complex View:
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE VIEW DepartmentSummary AS
SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(e.employee_id) AS total_employees, AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary
FROM departments d
JOIN employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name;
Explanation: The DepartmentSummary view aggregates the number of employees and average salary for each department by joining the departments and employees tables.
Using the Complex View:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM DepartmentSummary;
Explanation: This query retrieves summarized data about the departments and their employees.
Advantages of Views
Simplify complex queries: Instead of writing a complex query every time, you can create a view and reuse it.
Data abstraction: Hide the complexity of the underlying tables and represent data in a simpler format.
Security: Restrict access to specific columns and rows of data by presenting only a subset through a view.
Disadvantages of Views
Performance: Views donâ€™t store data, so every time they are queried, the underlying query is executed, which can be inefficient for complex views or large datasets.
No direct indexing: Views cannot be indexed directly, though indexes on the underlying tables can improve performance.
2. Materialized Views
A Materialized View is similar to a view, but it stores the result of the query physically. This makes querying a materialized view faster, especially for complex aggregations or large datasets. Materialized views can be refreshed periodically to reflect the latest data from the underlying tables.

Creating a Materialized View
A materialized view is created like a view, but the results are stored and refreshed when needed.

Example of a Materialized View:
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW DepartmentSummaryMatView AS
SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(e.employee_id) AS total_employees, AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary
FROM departments d
JOIN employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name;
Explanation: This is similar to the DepartmentSummary view, but the results are physically stored in the database, so queries on this materialized view are faster.
Refreshing a Materialized View:
sql
Copy
Edit
-- Manually refresh the materialized view to update the data
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW DepartmentSummaryMatView;
Explanation: This statement updates the materialized view with the latest data from the underlying tables. Depending on the database, the refresh may be done automatically or need to be scheduled.
Advantages of Materialized Views
Performance: Since the results are stored, querying a materialized view is much faster than querying a regular view, especially for large or complex datasets.
Reduced Computation: Complex queries can be computed once and reused, which saves processing time.
Disadvantages of Materialized Views
Storage: Materialized views require storage for the result set, which can take up more space.
Stale Data: The data in a materialized view may be out-of-date unless manually refreshed or automatically scheduled for periodic refresh.
3. Indexed Views
An Indexed View is a type of view in which indexes are created on the view itself, which can help improve query performance. This concept is primarily used in SQL Server, where a view can be indexed, and the data is physically stored in a special table-like structure.

Creating an Indexed View (SQL Server Example)
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE VIEW DepartmentSummaryIndexed
WITH SCHEMABINDING AS
SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(e.employee_id) AS total_employees
FROM departments d
JOIN employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name;

-- Create an index on the view
CREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_DepartmentSummary
ON DepartmentSummaryIndexed (department_name);
Explanation: The DepartmentSummaryIndexed view is created with the WITH SCHEMABINDING option, which allows it to be indexed. After creating the view, we can create a clustered index on the department_name column to improve query performance.
Advantages of Indexed Views
Improved performance: Queries on indexed views are faster because the data is physically stored and indexed.
Materialization: Indexed views combine the benefits of materialized views and indexing, improving both performance and data retrieval speed.
Disadvantages of Indexed Views
Performance overhead: Indexes on views come with a maintenance cost, especially for large datasets or frequent updates.
Limited to specific databases: Not all databases support indexed views.
4. Updatable vs Non-updatable Views
Updatable Views: These are views that allow you to perform INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on the underlying data through the view.
Non-updatable Views: These views do not support data modification operations. Typically, these are views based on multiple tables, joins, or aggregates.
Updatable View Example:
If you create a view based on a single table without any aggregation or joins, it will likely be updatable.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE VIEW EmployeeDetails AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, department
FROM employees;

-- This view is updatable
UPDATE EmployeeDetails
SET department = 'Marketing'
WHERE employee_id = 5;
Explanation: This view is updatable because it is based on a single table, and you can update the department column through the view.
Non-updatable View Example:
If the view involves multiple tables or aggregates, it becomes non-updatable.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE VIEW DepartmentSummaryNonUpdatable AS
SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(e.employee_id) AS total_employees
FROM departments d
JOIN employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_name;

-- This view is non-updatable because it is based on an aggregation (COUNT)
Explanation: The DepartmentSummaryNonUpdatable view is non-updatable because it involves an aggregation (COUNT) and a JOIN between multiple tables. You cannot update the data through this view.
Summary
Feature	Description	Example
Simple View	A view based on a single table, typically without joins or aggregations.	CREATE VIEW ActiveEmployees AS SELECT * FROM employees WHERE status = 'Active';
Complex View	A view based on multiple tables or with complex logic (joins, aggregations).	CREATE VIEW DepartmentSummary AS SELECT ... FROM departments d JOIN employees e ...
Materialized View	A view that stores the results of a query physically.	CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW DepartmentSummaryMatView AS SELECT ...
Indexed View	A view with an index, improving query performance in some DBMS.	CREATE VIEW DepartmentSummaryIndexed ... CREATE INDEX idx_DepartmentSummary ...
Updatable View	A view that allows data modifications.	CREATE VIEW EmployeeDetails AS SELECT * FROM employees; UPDATE EmployeeDetails ...
Non-updatable View	A view that does not support data modifications.	CREATE VIEW DepartmentSummaryNonUpdatable AS SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(e.employee_id) ...
Conclusion
Views and Materialized Views are essential tools for simplifying queries and improving performance. Views provide a way to abstract and present data, while materialized views help improve performance by caching query results. Indexed views allow for faster data retrieval with indexes. Updatable and Non-updatable views serve different use cases, with updatable views allowing changes to the underlying data and non-updatable views being restricted to select-only operations.
