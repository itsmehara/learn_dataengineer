SQL Subqueries & Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
In SQL, subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) allow you to write more modular, flexible, and readable queries. They both involve writing one query inside another, but they have different use cases and advantages.

1. Subqueries
A subquery is a query that is embedded within another SQL query. Subqueries are used to return a single value, a set of values, or even a table to be used by the outer query.

Types of Subqueries:
Scalar Subqueries
Correlated Subqueries
Nested Subqueries
Scalar Subquery
A scalar subquery returns a single value (a single column and row). This type of subquery is often used in WHERE, HAVING, or SELECT clauses where only a single value is expected.

Example: Use of a scalar subquery in the WHERE clause.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Name, Age 
FROM Employees
WHERE Age = (SELECT MAX(Age) FROM Employees);
In this example, the subquery (SELECT MAX(Age) FROM Employees) returns the maximum age, and the outer query selects the employee(s) with that age.

When to use:
When you need to compare a column value to a calculated result (e.g., finding the highest, lowest, or average value).
Correlated Subquery
A correlated subquery is a subquery that references a column from the outer query. This type of subquery is evaluated once for each row in the outer query.

Example: Using a correlated subquery to find employees whose salary is higher than the average salary in their department.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Name, Salary, DeptID 
FROM Employees e
WHERE Salary > (
    SELECT AVG(Salary) 
    FROM Employees 
    WHERE DeptID = e.DeptID
);
In this example, the subquery uses the DeptID from the outer query (e.DeptID) to calculate the average salary for each department. For each employee, the subquery is executed to compare the employee's salary against the department's average.
When to use:
When you need to reference a column from the outer query within the subquery.
Nested Subquery
A nested subquery is a subquery that is embedded inside another subquery. These can be scalar, correlated, or even complex queries.

Example: A nested subquery to find employees whose salary is higher than the average salary of employees in a specific department.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Name, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE DeptID = 3
AND Salary > (
    SELECT AVG(Salary)
    FROM Employees
    WHERE DeptID = 3
);
This query has a nested subquery within the WHERE clause. The inner query calculates the average salary for department 3, and the outer query selects the employees whose salary exceeds that value.
When to use:
When you need to perform calculations that require multiple levels of nesting.
2. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary result set that can be referenced within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. CTEs make queries more readable and modular by breaking complex queries into simpler parts.

A CTE is defined using the WITH keyword and can be used for both non-recursive and recursive queries.

Basic CTE Example
A simple non-recursive CTE can be used to simplify a query, especially for cases where you need to reference the same subquery multiple times.

sql
Copy
Edit
WITH EmployeeAvg AS (
    SELECT DeptID, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY DeptID
)
SELECT e.Name, e.Salary, ea.AvgSalary
FROM Employees e
JOIN EmployeeAvg ea ON e.DeptID = ea.DeptID
WHERE e.Salary > ea.AvgSalary;
In this example, EmployeeAvg is a CTE that calculates the average salary for each department. The outer query joins the Employees table with the EmployeeAvg CTE to find employees whose salary is higher than the department's average.
When to use:
When a complex query is needed with multiple subqueries, or when the same subquery is referenced multiple times in the query.
3. Recursive CTEs
A recursive CTE is a type of CTE that references itself. Recursive CTEs are commonly used for hierarchical data structures, such as organizational charts, bill-of-materials, or folder structures.

A recursive CTE consists of two parts:

Base case: The initial query that starts the recursion.
Recursive case: A query that references the CTE itself to continue the recursion.
Example: Finding all employees in a company who report to a specific manager.

sql
Copy
Edit
WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS (
    -- Base case: Get the top-level managers
    SELECT EmpID, Name, ManagerID
    FROM Employees
    WHERE ManagerID IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive case: Get employees who report to the current set of employees
    SELECT e.EmpID, e.Name, e.ManagerID
    FROM Employees e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.ManagerID = eh.EmpID
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy;
In this example, the base case selects the top-level managers (those who have no manager). The recursive case then selects employees who report to the current set of employees in the EmployeeHierarchy CTE, continuing until all employees have been listed.
When to use:
When dealing with hierarchical data, such as organizational structures, folder structures, or recursive relationships.
Summary of SQL Subqueries & CTEs:
Type	Description	Example
Scalar Subquery	Returns a single value (e.g., a number or string) and is used in expressions.	SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE Age = (SELECT MAX(Age) FROM Employees)
Correlated Subquery	References a column from the outer query and is evaluated for each row.	SELECT Name FROM Employees e WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees WHERE DeptID = e.DeptID)
Nested Subquery	A subquery inside another subquery.	SELECT Name FROM Employees WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees WHERE DeptID = 3)
Common Table Expressions (CTEs)	A temporary result set that simplifies complex queries.	WITH EmployeeAvg AS (SELECT DeptID, AVG(Salary) FROM Employees GROUP BY DeptID) SELECT * FROM Employees e JOIN EmployeeAvg ea ON e.DeptID = ea.DeptID
Recursive CTE	A CTE that references itself to handle recursive queries, such as hierarchies.	WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS (SELECT EmpID, Name, ManagerID FROM Employees WHERE ManagerID IS NULL UNION ALL SELECT e.EmpID, e.Name, e.ManagerID FROM Employees e INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.ManagerID = eh.EmpID) SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy
Key Points:
Subqueries are used to break down complex queries, often in WHERE or SELECT clauses.
CTEs are more readable and modular, and they can be used for both recursive and non-recursive queries.
Recursive CTEs are essential for working with hierarchical data, such as trees or organizational charts.
