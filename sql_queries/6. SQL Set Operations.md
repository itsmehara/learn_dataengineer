SQL Set Operations
SQL set operations allow you to combine the results of two or more queries into a single result set. The most common set operations are UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT.

Each of these operations performs a different function when combining the result sets of two queries, and they have specific use cases.

Key Points About Set Operations:
Set operations combine the results of two queries by comparing the rows.
Each set operation requires that the queries being combined return the same number of columns with compatible data types.
Set operations ignore duplicates by default (except for UNION ALL).
1. UNION
The UNION operation combines the results of two queries and removes any duplicate rows. It is useful when you want to merge data from two or more result sets but exclude duplicates.

Example of UNION:
Consider two tables: Customers_USA and Customers_Canada.

Customers_USA Table:

CustomerID	Name	Country
1	Alice	USA
2	Bob	USA
3	Charlie	USA
Customers_Canada Table:

CustomerID	Name	Country
4	David	Canada
5	Emma	Canada
3	Charlie	Canada
Now, let's combine the data from both tables but remove duplicates:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Name, Country FROM Customers_USA
UNION
SELECT Name, Country FROM Customers_Canada;
Result:

Name	Country
Alice	USA
Bob	USA
Charlie	USA
David	Canada
Emma	Canada
Explanation: The UNION operator combines the rows from both tables and removes the duplicate entry for Charlie since it appears in both tables (USA and Canada).
2. UNION ALL
The UNION ALL operation combines the results of two queries, including duplicates. Unlike UNION, it does not remove duplicate rows.

Example of UNION ALL:
Using the same Customers_USA and Customers_Canada tables, if we use UNION ALL instead of UNION, the result will include all rows, including duplicates.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Name, Country FROM Customers_USA
UNION ALL
SELECT Name, Country FROM Customers_Canada;
Result:

Name	Country
Alice	USA
Bob	USA
Charlie	USA
David	Canada
Emma	Canada
Charlie	Canada
Explanation: Here, Charlie appears twice—once from the Customers_USA table and once from the Customers_Canada table—because UNION ALL does not eliminate duplicates.
3. INTERSECT
The INTERSECT operation returns only the rows that appear in both queries. It finds the common rows between the result sets of two queries.

Example of INTERSECT:
Let's say we have the same two tables (Customers_USA and Customers_Canada), and we want to find the customers who appear in both tables.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Name, Country FROM Customers_USA
INTERSECT
SELECT Name, Country FROM Customers_Canada;
Result:

Name	Country
Charlie	USA
Explanation: The result shows that Charlie appears in both the Customers_USA and Customers_Canada tables with the same name and country.

Note: The INTERSECT operation is often used when you want to find the common data between two result sets.

4. EXCEPT
The EXCEPT operation returns the rows that are present in the first query but not in the second query. It's used to find the difference between two result sets.

Example of EXCEPT:
If we want to find the customers who are in the Customers_USA table but not in the Customers_Canada table, we can use EXCEPT.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT Name, Country FROM Customers_USA
EXCEPT
SELECT Name, Country FROM Customers_Canada;
Result:

Name	Country
Alice	USA
Bob	USA
Explanation: The result shows that Alice and Bob are in the Customers_USA table, but they do not appear in the Customers_Canada table.

Note: EXCEPT works like a set difference, meaning it returns the rows that are in the first result set but not in the second.

Summary Table:
Set Operation	Description	Includes Duplicates?	Use Case
UNION	Combines results from two queries, removing duplicates.	No	Use when you want to merge data from two queries and eliminate duplicates.
UNION ALL	Combines results from two queries, including duplicates.	Yes	Use when you want to include all results, even duplicates.
INTERSECT	Returns rows that appear in both queries.	No	Use when you want to find common rows between two queries.
EXCEPT	Returns rows from the first query that do not appear in the second.	No	Use when you want to find rows in one query that are not in another.
Key Points:
UNION removes duplicates, merging the result sets of both queries.
UNION ALL combines the result sets without removing duplicates.
INTERSECT finds the common rows between two queries.
EXCEPT returns rows from the first query that do not exist in the second query.
These set operations are powerful tools for combining data from multiple sources and are useful in various scenarios, such as when comparing datasets, merging data, or filtering results based on common or unique values.
