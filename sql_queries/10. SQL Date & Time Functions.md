SQL provides various date and time functions that allow you to manipulate and format date and time values effectively. These functions are useful for handling everything from basic date arithmetic to time zone conversions.

Let’s break down key SQL date and time functions, along with examples.

1. Date Arithmetic
Date arithmetic involves adding or subtracting intervals (days, months, years, etc.) to/from dates or timestamps.

Adding/Subtracting Days to a Date
You can add or subtract days from a date using the + or - operator.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '10' DAY AS future_date,
       CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '10' DAY AS past_date;
Explanation: This will give you the date 10 days from today (future_date) and 10 days ago (past_date).
Adding/Subtracting Months or Years
You can add or subtract months and years in a similar way.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '2' MONTH AS two_months_later,
       CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1' YEAR AS one_year_earlier;
Explanation: This adds 2 months to the current date and subtracts 1 year from it.
Date Difference (Days between Dates)
To find the difference between two dates in terms of days, you can subtract one date from another.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT CURRENT_DATE - '2024-01-01' AS days_diff;
Explanation: This returns the number of days between CURRENT_DATE and January 1, 2024.
2. Extracting Date Parts
SQL provides functions to extract specific parts (like the year, month, day, etc.) from a date or timestamp.

EXTRACT()
The EXTRACT() function allows you to pull specific parts (e.g., year, month, day, etc.) from a date or timestamp.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) AS year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM CURRENT_DATE) AS month,
       EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_DATE) AS day;
Explanation: This will return the current year, month, and day.
DATE_PART()
The DATE_PART() function is similar to EXTRACT(), often used interchangeably in different databases (e.g., PostgreSQL uses DATE_PART()).

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT DATE_PART('year', CURRENT_DATE) AS year,
       DATE_PART('month', CURRENT_DATE) AS month,
       DATE_PART('day', CURRENT_DATE) AS day;
Explanation: This returns the year, month, and day of the current date, similar to EXTRACT().
3. Converting & Formatting Dates
SQL provides functions to format dates into a string format and convert between different date types.

TO_DATE()
TO_DATE() is used to convert a string into a date format.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT TO_DATE('2024-12-25', 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS converted_date;
Explanation: This converts the string '2024-12-25' into a date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
TO_CHAR()
TO_CHAR() is used to format a date (or timestamp) into a string according to a specified format.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'DD/MM/YYYY') AS formatted_date;
Explanation: This will return the current date in DD/MM/YYYY format, like 10/02/2025.
DATE_FORMAT() (MySQL-specific)
MySQL offers DATE_FORMAT() for converting date values to a specific format.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s') AS formatted_datetime;
Explanation: This will format the current date and time in the YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.
4. Handling Time Zones
Handling time zones is important when dealing with applications across different geographic locations. SQL databases provide functions to manage and convert between time zones.

CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP returns the current date and time in the server's time zone.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AS current_time;
Explanation: This returns the current date and time in the default time zone of the database server.
AT TIME ZONE
The AT TIME ZONE function (supported in PostgreSQL and other DBMSs) allows you to convert a timestamp from one time zone to another.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' AS utc_time,
       CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York' AS ny_time;
Explanation: This converts the current timestamp to UTC and New York time, respectively.
CONVERT_TZ() (MySQL-specific)
In MySQL, CONVERT_TZ() is used to convert a timestamp from one time zone to another.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT CONVERT_TZ(NOW(), 'UTC', 'America/Los_Angeles') AS la_time;
Explanation: This converts the current timestamp from UTC to Los Angeles time.
Summary of SQL Date & Time Functions
Function	Description	Example Query
DATE Arithmetic	Adding or subtracting days, months, years, etc. to/from a date.	SELECT CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '10' DAY;
EXTRACT()	Extracts specific parts (year, month, day, etc.) from a date.	SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE);
DATE_PART()	Extracts specific parts from a date (PostgreSQL).	SELECT DATE_PART('month', CURRENT_DATE);
TO_DATE()	Converts a string into a date.	SELECT TO_DATE('2024-12-25', 'YYYY-MM-DD');
TO_CHAR()	Formats a date into a string with a specific format.	SELECT TO_CHAR(CURRENT_DATE, 'DD/MM/YYYY');
DATE_FORMAT()	MySQL function to format date values.	SELECT DATE_FORMAT(NOW(), '%Y-%m-%d %H:%i:%s');
CURRENT_TIMESTAMP	Returns the current date and time in the server’s time zone.	SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;

Conclusion
SQL provides a wide array of functions for handling dates and times, including arithmetic, formatting, extracting date parts, and time zone conversions. These functions are crucial for working with date-related data, especially when dealing with time-sensitive applications or data stored across different time zones. By mastering these functions, you can perform complex date operations efficiently and with ease.
