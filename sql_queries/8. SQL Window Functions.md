SQL window functions allow you to perform calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row, without having to collapse the result set. Window functions are extremely useful for performing operations like ranking, cumulative totals, or moving averages without grouping rows into summary results.

Let’s break down each of the common window functions with examples.

1. ROW_NUMBER()
The ROW_NUMBER() function assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a result set. The numbering starts at 1 and is reset for each partition (if partitioning is applied).

Example: Suppose we have an employees table with employee_id, department, and salary.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employee_id, department, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
FROM employees;
Explanation: For each department, employees are ordered by their salary in descending order. ROW_NUMBER() assigns a unique row number starting from 1 within each department.
2. RANK() & DENSE_RANK()
RANK(): This function provides the rank of a row in a result set, but it will leave gaps if there are ties (i.e., rows with equal values).
DENSE_RANK(): Similar to RANK(), but it does not leave gaps when there are ties (i.e., the next rank will be consecutive).
Example: Using the employees table again with salary:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employee_id, department, salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM employees;
Explanation: Both RANK() and DENSE_RANK() will assign ranks to employees based on their salary within each department. If two employees share the same salary:
RANK() will skip the next rank (e.g., if two employees are tied at rank 1, the next rank will be 3).
DENSE_RANK() will assign consecutive ranks (e.g., if two employees are tied at rank 1, the next rank will be 2).
3. NTILE()
The NTILE() function divides the result set into a specified number of "buckets" or partitions and assigns each row to a bucket. This is useful for dividing data into quartiles, deciles, etc.

Example: Let's assume you want to divide employees into 4 quartiles based on their salary:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employee_id, department, salary,
       NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_quartile
FROM employees;
Explanation: The employees in each department will be split into 4 equal-sized groups (quartiles) based on their salary.
4. LEAD() & LAG()
LEAD(): Returns the value of a row that comes after the current row in the result set.
LAG(): Returns the value of a row that comes before the current row in the result set.
Both LEAD() and LAG() can be useful for comparing the current row’s value with another row’s value in the result set (e.g., comparing consecutive rows).

Example: If you want to compare each employee's salary with the salary of the next employee in the list:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employee_id, department, salary,
       LEAD(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS next_salary,
       LAG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS previous_salary
FROM employees;
Explanation: The LEAD() function will return the salary of the next employee (within the same department), and LAG() will return the salary of the previous employee.
5. FIRST_VALUE() & LAST_VALUE()
FIRST_VALUE(): Returns the value of the first row in a result set within the window.
LAST_VALUE(): Returns the value of the last row in a result set within the window.
Example: If you want to get the highest (first) and lowest (last) salaries within each department:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employee_id, department, salary,
       FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS highest_salary,
       LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS lowest_salary
FROM employees;
Explanation: FIRST_VALUE(salary) returns the highest salary in each department (since we are ordering by salary DESC), and LAST_VALUE(salary) returns the lowest salary. The ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING ensures that the window includes all rows for the department.
6. Running Totals & Moving Averages
Running Totals: A running total calculates the cumulative sum up to the current row.
Moving Averages: A moving average calculates the average over a set window of rows.
Running Total Example:
Suppose you want to calculate the running total of sales:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT order_id, sale_amount,
       SUM(sale_amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_id) AS running_total
FROM sales;
Explanation: The SUM(sale_amount) is calculated cumulatively as the rows are ordered by order_id. The running_total will show the cumulative sales at each order.
Moving Average Example:
Suppose you want to calculate a 3-day moving average of sales:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT order_id, sale_amount,
       AVG(sale_amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_id ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg
FROM sales;
Explanation: This computes the average sales for the current row and the two previous rows (i.e., a 3-day moving average).
Summary of Window Functions
Function	Description	Example Query
ROW_NUMBER()	Assigns a unique row number to each row in a partition.	ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
RANK()	Assigns ranks with gaps for ties.	RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
DENSE_RANK()	Assigns ranks without gaps for ties.	DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
NTILE()	Divides rows into a specified number of buckets (e.g., quartiles).	NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
LEAD()	Returns the value of the next row in the result set.	LEAD(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
LAG()	Returns the value of the previous row in the result set.	LAG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
FIRST_VALUE()	Returns the first value in the window.	FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
LAST_VALUE()	Returns the last value in the window.	LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)
Running Total	Calculates the cumulative sum up to the current row.	SUM(sale_amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_id)
Moving Average	Calculates the average over a specified window of rows.	AVG(sale_amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_id ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
Window functions allow you to perform complex analytics like rankings, cumulative totals, and moving averages with minimal effort, making them a powerful tool for advanced SQL queries.
