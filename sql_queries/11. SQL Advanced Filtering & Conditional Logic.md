SQL Advanced Filtering & Conditional Logic
SQL provides a variety of advanced filtering and conditional logic capabilities to enhance query flexibility. These include CASE statements, COALESCE, NULLIF, EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, and filtering with IN, ANY, and ALL. Let's go through each of these with detailed explanations and examples.

1. CASE Statements
The CASE statement is SQL's way of performing conditional logic, similar to an if-else statement in programming. It is used to return a value based on specific conditions.

Syntax:
sql
Copy
Edit
CASE
  WHEN condition1 THEN result1
  WHEN condition2 THEN result2
  ELSE result3
END
condition1, condition2: Conditions that will be evaluated.
result1, result2: Values returned when conditions are true.
ELSE: Optional. Specifies a default value if no condition matches.
Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employee_id, salary,
  CASE
    WHEN salary >= 50000 THEN 'High Salary'
    WHEN salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 49999 THEN 'Medium Salary'
    ELSE 'Low Salary'
  END AS salary_category
FROM employees;
Explanation: This query categorizes employees into three salary categories based on their salary. The CASE statement is used to return 'High Salary', 'Medium Salary', or 'Low Salary' based on the salary value.
Result:
employee_id	salary	salary_category
1	60000	High Salary
2	45000	Medium Salary
3	20000	Low Salary
2. COALESCE & NULLIF
COALESCE: Returns the first non-NULL value from a list of expressions.
NULLIF: Compares two expressions, and if they are equal, returns NULL; otherwise, returns the first expression.
COALESCE Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employee_id, COALESCE(phone_number, 'No Phone') AS contact_info
FROM employees;
Explanation: If the phone_number is NULL, it will return 'No Phone'. Otherwise, it returns the phone number.
NULLIF Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employee_id, salary, NULLIF(salary, 0) AS adjusted_salary
FROM employees;
Explanation: If salary is 0, the NULLIF function will return NULL; otherwise, it returns the salary value.
Result:
employee_id	salary	adjusted_salary
1	50000	50000
2	0	NULL
3. EXISTS & NOT EXISTS
The EXISTS operator is used to test whether a subquery returns any results. It returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more rows and FALSE otherwise. NOT EXISTS is the opposite; it returns TRUE if the subquery returns no rows.

EXISTS Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT department_name
FROM departments d
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM employees e
    WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
);
Explanation: This query returns department names that have at least one employee (i.e., the EXISTS clause ensures that the department has related employees).
NOT EXISTS Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT department_name
FROM departments d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM employees e
    WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
);
Explanation: This query returns department names that do not have any employees (i.e., the NOT EXISTS clause ensures that there are no employees in the department).
4. Filtering with IN, ANY, ALL
IN Operator
The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause, checking if a column's value matches any value in the list.

Syntax:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT column1
FROM table
WHERE column1 IN (value1, value2, value3, ...);
IN Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employee_id, department
FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing');
Explanation: This query retrieves all employees who work in the 'Sales' or 'Marketing' department.
ANY & ALL Operators
ANY: Compares a value to each value in the list and returns TRUE if the condition is met for any of the values.
ALL: Compares a value to each value in the list and returns TRUE if the condition is met for all values.
ANY Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employee_id, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > ANY (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales');
Explanation: This query retrieves employees whose salary is greater than any salary in the 'Sales' department.
ALL Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employee_id, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > ALL (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales');
Explanation: This query retrieves employees whose salary is greater than all salaries in the 'Sales' department.
5. Combining Multiple Filters (Advanced Example)
You can combine multiple filtering conditions using logical operators like AND, OR, or NOT, along with IN, ANY, ALL, and EXISTS.

Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT employee_id, salary, department
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000
  AND department IN ('HR', 'Engineering')
  AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM projects p
      WHERE p.employee_id = employees.employee_id
      AND p.project_status = 'Active'
  );
Explanation: This query retrieves employees who meet the following conditions:
Earn more than 50,000.
Belong to the 'HR' or 'Engineering' department.
Are assigned to an 'Active' project in the projects table.
Summary of Advanced Filtering & Conditional Logic
Operator/Function	Description	Example
CASE	Conditional logic, like if-else. Can be used in SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE statements.	CASE WHEN salary >= 50000 THEN 'High' ELSE 'Low' END AS salary_category
COALESCE	Returns the first non-NULL value in a list of expressions.	COALESCE(phone_number, 'No Phone')
NULLIF	Returns NULL if two expressions are equal, otherwise returns the first expression.	NULLIF(salary, 0)
EXISTS	Returns TRUE if the subquery returns any rows.	WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employees WHERE department_id = d.department_id)
NOT EXISTS	Returns TRUE if the subquery returns no rows.	WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM employees WHERE department_id = d.department_id)
IN	Filters rows where the column matches any of the specified values in a list.	WHERE department IN ('Sales', 'HR')
ANY	Compares a value with any value in a list. Returns TRUE if the condition is met for any value.	WHERE salary > ANY (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales')
ALL	Compares a value with all values in a list. Returns TRUE if the condition is met for all values.	WHERE salary > ALL (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales')
Conclusion
SQL offers powerful tools for advanced filtering and conditional logic that help manage complex queries and logic. Using CASE statements, COALESCE, NULLIF, and operators like IN, ANY, ALL, and EXISTS, you can manipulate, filter, and derive data based on complex conditions, making SQL a robust language for querying and manipulating data.
