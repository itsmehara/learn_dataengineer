SQL Transactions provide a mechanism to ensure that a series of operations on a database are executed in a way that guarantees the integrity of the data. The ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) define the criteria that a transaction must meet to be considered reliable. Let’s explore these concepts in detail along with practical examples.

1. SQL Transactions & ACID Properties
The ACID properties ensure that database transactions are processed reliably and securely. Here's a breakdown:

Atomicity: This ensures that a transaction is fully completed or not executed at all. If one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
Consistency: The database must be in a consistent state before and after the transaction. It must follow all rules, constraints, and triggers defined in the schema.
Isolation: Ensures that the operations of one transaction are isolated from other transactions, preventing conflicts and inconsistencies.
Durability: Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent, even in the event of a system failure.
2. COMMIT & ROLLBACK
Transactions are typically controlled by COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements.

COMMIT
The COMMIT statement is used to make all changes made during a transaction permanent in the database.

Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
BEGIN;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2;

COMMIT;
Explanation: This transaction transfers $500 from account_id = 1 to account_id = 2. The COMMIT ensures that both updates are permanently saved in the database.
ROLLBACK
The ROLLBACK statement is used to undo all changes made during a transaction, reverting the database back to its state before the transaction started.

Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
BEGIN;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2;

-- Something goes wrong (e.g., an error occurs)
ROLLBACK;
Explanation: If there is an error after the first update (before committing), the ROLLBACK ensures that both operations are undone, and the database is not modified.
3. Savepoints & Nested Transactions
Savepoints allow you to set points within a transaction that can be rolled back to, without affecting the entire transaction. This is useful in long transactions, where you may want to undo part of the transaction but keep other parts intact.

Savepoints
A SAVEPOINT sets a point in a transaction to which you can later roll back.

Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
BEGIN;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;
SAVEPOINT mid_transaction;  -- Set a savepoint

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2;

-- Something goes wrong, so we roll back to the savepoint
ROLLBACK TO mid_transaction;

COMMIT;
Explanation: In this case, if there is an error after the second update, we can roll back to the SAVEPOINT (which preserves the first update) and continue the transaction from there.
Nested Transactions (not supported in all DBMS)
Some databases support nested transactions, where a transaction can have sub-transactions (child transactions) that can be committed or rolled back independently.

Explanation: Nested transactions allow for more fine-grained control within a larger transaction. If a child transaction fails, you can decide whether to roll back just the child transaction or the entire parent transaction.
However, it’s worth noting that not all databases support true nested transactions. For example, in PostgreSQL, a subtransaction is achieved using SAVEPOINT.

4. Isolation Levels
The isolation level of a transaction defines how the operations within it are isolated from other transactions running concurrently. There are four main isolation levels:

READ UNCOMMITTED
At this level, a transaction can read data that is not yet committed by other transactions (dirty reads).

Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;

BEGIN;

-- Transaction A can see uncommitted changes made by Transaction B
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;
Explanation: If another transaction (Transaction B) updates a record and does not commit, Transaction A can still see that uncommitted data.
READ COMMITTED
At this level, a transaction can only read data that has been committed by other transactions. It prevents dirty reads, but it allows non-repeatable reads (i.e., the data read in one query might change if the transaction is retried).

Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

BEGIN;

-- Transaction A sees only committed changes from Transaction B
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;
Explanation: Transaction A cannot read uncommitted data, but if it queries the same row multiple times, the result might change if other transactions modify the row between queries (non-repeatable read).
REPEATABLE READ
This level ensures that if a transaction reads a value, the value will not change during the transaction (it prevents non-repeatable reads), but it allows phantom reads (new rows can be added that match the query’s condition).

Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;

BEGIN;

-- Transaction A will always see the same data during the entire transaction
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;
Explanation: Any data read by Transaction A will not change during the transaction, preventing non-repeatable reads. However, if other transactions insert new rows that meet the same conditions, Transaction A will still not see those rows.
SERIALIZABLE
This is the highest isolation level, where transactions are executed in such a way that the results are as if they were run sequentially. It prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

Example:
sql
Copy
Edit
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;

BEGIN;

-- Transaction A executes as if it is the only transaction running
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;
Explanation: This ensures complete isolation of the transaction. No other transactions can read, write, or modify the data that Transaction A is working with until it completes.
Summary of Isolation Levels
Isolation Level	Dirty Reads	Non-Repeatable Reads	Phantom Reads
READ UNCOMMITTED	Allowed	Allowed	Allowed
READ COMMITTED	Not Allowed	Allowed	Allowed
REPEATABLE READ	Not Allowed	Not Allowed	Allowed
SERIALIZABLE	Not Allowed	Not Allowed	Not Allowed
Conclusion
SQL transactions and ACID properties play a vital role in ensuring the integrity and reliability of database operations. By using COMMIT and ROLLBACK, you can control the success or failure of a series of operations. Savepoints and nested transactions allow for more granular control within a transaction. The isolation levels control how transactions interact with each other, and you can choose the appropriate level based on your consistency and concurrency needs. By understanding and applying these concepts, you can write more robust and fault-tolerant SQL queries and applications.
