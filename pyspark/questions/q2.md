3. Explain the concept of transformations and actions in PySpark.
4. How do you filter data in PySpark?
5. Can you provide an example of a map operation in PySpark?
6. What is the difference between map and flatMap transformations?
7. How do you perform aggregation operations in PySpark?
8. What is the purpose of the collect action in PySpark?
9. How can you count the number of elements in an RDD/DataFrame in PySpark?
10. Explain the concept of lazy evaluation and its significance in PySpark.
11. What is the difference between persist and cache methods in PySpark?
12. How do you perform sorting operations in PySpark?
13. Can you explain the concept of shuffling in PySpark?
14. What is the purpose of the reduceByKey operation in PySpark?
15. How do you handle errors and exceptions while performing operations in PySpark?

**Advanced Questions:**

1. Discuss the performance implications of using transformations versus actions in PySpark.
2. Can you explain the difference between narrow and wide transformations and their impact on the execution plan?
3. How does PySpark handle data skewness during shuffling operations?
4. Explain the concept of partitioning in PySpark and its importance in distributed computing.
5. What are some optimization techniques you can employ to improve the performance of PySpark jobs?
6. Discuss the advantages and limitations of using DataFrame operations over RDD transformations.
7. How does PySpark handle fault tolerance in the event of task failures?
8. Explain the concept of checkpointing in PySpark and when it is necessary.
9. How does PySpark handle large datasets that exceed the available memory?
10. Discuss the significance of the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) in PySpark's execution model.
11. Can you provide examples of advanced aggregation operations using combineByKey or aggregateByKey in PySpark?
12. Explain the difference between local and distributed variables in PySpark.
13. How do you handle nested data structures (e.g., arrays, structs) in PySpark transformations?
14. Discuss the limitations of using collect action on large datasets in PySpark.
15. How do you deal with skewed data distribution in join operations in PySpark?
