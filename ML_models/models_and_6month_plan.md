Good catch ‚Äî your question is **very important**.

üëâ In the **earlier list** I gave, **models** were covered **inside topics**, like:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- SVM
- KNN
- KMeans
- PCA
- XGBoost, etc.

‚úÖ But if you are asking **explicitly** ‚Äî "**should I learn how models internally work, mathematically and intuitively**" ‚Äî **then YES**, that needs a dedicated line item!

### Here‚Äôs the additional major **ML Models Understanding** topic (to **insert in your full plan**):

---

## 10. **Model Internals ‚Äî How ML Algorithms Work (Deep Understanding)**

- **Subtopics:**
  - Linear Models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression math derivation)
  - Decision Trees (Entropy, Gini, Information Gain)
  - SVM (Maximal margin, Kernels, Soft Margin)
  - KNN (Lazy learning, Distance metrics)
  - Ensemble Learning Internals (Bagging, Boosting Mechanics)
  - KMeans (Centroid updates, Distance calculation)
  - PCA (Covariance matrix, Eigen decomposition)
  - XGBoost internals (Additive model, Loss + Regularization optimization)

- **Challenges / Cases:**
  - Derive linear regression using normal equation
  - Build a decision tree manually (draw the split tree by hand)
  - Plot margins of SVM manually for simple dataset
  - Show how boosting improves weak learners
  - Simulate clustering step-by-step for KMeans
  - Reduce dimensionality of a simple 3D dataset manually using PCA
  - Explain how XGBoost regularizes model to prevent overfitting

---

‚úÖ So now your **full learning** includes **understanding each model‚Äôs working in detail**, not just ‚Äúusing them‚Äù blindly.
